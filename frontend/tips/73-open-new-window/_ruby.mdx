## Example

To open a new window, you call the driver you instantiated with a method that allows you to switch to a new window or tab.

After using the new window (or tab) method, use the `driver.get` method to navigate to a website or URL. See the examples in the table of the previous section to see how this would be implemented.

Now you can add any other actions or assertions youâ€™d like to do on the page. In the `Ruby` example below, you can see how a test and multiple windows are created and handled:

```ruby
#filename new-window.rb

require 'selenium-webdriver'
require 'rspec/expectations'

include RSpec::Matchers

def setup
  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
end

def teardown
  @driver.quit
end

def run
  setup
  yield
  teardown
end

run do
  @driver.get("https://the-internet.herokuapp.com")
  @driver.switch_to.new_window(:window)
  @driver.manage.window.position = Selenium::WebDriver::Point.new(100, 400)
  @driver.get("https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/typos")

  windows_count = @driver.window_handles.length
  if windows_count == 2
    puts "Test passed: Found 2 windows open"
  else
    raise "Expected 2 windows, but found #{windows_count}"
end
end
```

## Expected Behavior

If you run the `Ruby` example referenced above (`ruby new-window.rb`), this test will:

- Open Firefox browser
- Navigate to the-internet website
- Open a New Window and move it to a different position on the screen
- Navigate to the Typos page on the-internet website
- Check the number of windows open
- Close all browsers

## Summary

There are many possible use cases for this new way of opening and focusing on new browser tabs and windows across OS and browser combinations.

From testing the way a user can interact with two windows side-by-side, to testing performance and behavior of multiple windows, this new command makes it simpler to test on multiple web pages.

Happy Testing!
