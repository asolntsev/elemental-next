## Example

Let's start by pulling in our requisite libraries, declare the test class, and wire up some simple `setUp` and `tearDown` methods.

```python
# filename: right_click.py
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By


class RightClick(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()
# ...
```

Now we're ready to write our test.

We'll use an example from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) that will render a custom context menu when we right-click on a specific area of the page ([link](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/context_menu)). Clicking the context menu will trigger a JavaScript alert which will say `You selected a context menu`. We'll grab this text and use it to assert that the menu was actually triggered.

```python
# filename: right_click.py
# ...
    def test_example_1(self):
        driver = self.driver
        driver.get('http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/context_menu')
        menu_area = driver.find_element(By.ID,'hot-spot')
        ActionChains(driver).context_click(
            menu_area).send_keys(
            Keys.ARROW_DOWN).send_keys(
            Keys.ARROW_DOWN).send_keys(
            Keys.ARROW_DOWN).send_keys(
            Keys.ENTER).perform()
        alert = driver.switch_to.alert
        assert alert.text == 'You selected a context menu'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## Expected Behavior

When we save this file and run it (e.g., `python right_click.py`) from the command-line) here is what will happen:

+ Open the browser and visit the page
+ Find and right-click the area which will render a custom context menu
+ Select the context menu option with keyboard keys
+ JavaScript alert appears
+ Grab the text of the JavaScript alert
+ Assert that the text from the alert is what we expect
+ Close the browser
