# How To Work With Frames

## Intro

In this tip, you'll learn how to work with frames and write tests against them.

On occasion, we may encounter relics of the front-end world, such as frames. When writing tests against them, it's easy to make a mistake if we're not paying attention.

## A Solution

Rather than getting frustrated when authoring your tests, you can work with the elements in a frame by telling Selenium to switch to that frame first. Then the rest of your test should be more straightforward.

Let's explore further with some examples.

## Example

We'll first need to pull in our requisite libraries, declare our test class, and wire up some setup and teardown methods for our tests.

## Summary

Now you can readily defeat frames when they cross your path.

Happy Testing!
