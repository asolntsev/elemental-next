## Example

Let's start by importing our requisite classes for our test framework (e.g., `NUnit.Framework`), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `OpenQA.Selenium`, etc.), and start our class off with some setup and teardown methods.

```csharp
// filename: RightClick.cs
using NUnit.Framework;
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Interactions;

public class RightClick
{
    IWebDriver Driver;

    [SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        Driver = new FirefoxDriver();
    }

    [TearDown]
    public void TearDown()
    {
        Driver.Quit();
    }
// ...
```

Now we're ready to write our test.

Let's use an example from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) that will render a custom context menu when we right-click on a specific area of the page ([link](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/context_menu)).

Clicking the context menu item will trigger a JavaScript alert which will say `You selected a context menu`. We'll grab this text and use it to assert that the menu was actually triggered.

```csharp
// filename: RightClick.cs
// ...
    [Test]
    public void RightClickExample()
    {
        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/context_menu");
        IWebElement MenuArea = Driver.FindElement(By.Id("hot-spot"));
        Actions Builder = new Actions(Driver);
        Builder.ContextClick(MenuArea)
            .SendKeys(Keys.ArrowDown)
            .SendKeys(Keys.ArrowDown)
            .SendKeys(Keys.ArrowDown)
            .SendKeys(Keys.ArrowDown)
            .SendKeys(Keys.ArrowDown)
            .SendKeys(Keys.Enter)
            .Perform();
        IAlert Alert = Driver.SwitchTo().Alert();
        Assert.That(Alert.Text.Equals("You selected a context menu"));
    }
}
```

## Expected Behavior

When you save this file and run it (e.g., `nunit3-console.exe .\RightClick.sln` from the command-line) here is what will happen.

- Open the browser
- Visit the page
- Find and right-click the area of the page that renders a custom context menu
- Navigate to the context menu option with keyboard keys and select it
- JavaScript alert appears
- Grab the text of the JavaScript alert
- Assert that the text from the alert is what we expect
- Close the browser
