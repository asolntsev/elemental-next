## Example

First let's include our requisite classes for our test framework (e.g., `NUnit.Framework`), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `OpenQA.Selenium`, etc.), and start our class off with some setup and teardown methods.

```csharp
// filename: KeyboardKeys.cs
using NUnit.Framework;
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Interactions;

public class KeyboardKeys
{
    IWebDriver Driver;

    [SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        Driver = new FirefoxDriver();
    }

    [TearDown]
    public void TearDown()
    {
        Driver.Quit();
    }
// ...
```

Now we can wire up our test.

Let's use an example from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) that will display what key has been pressed ([link](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses)). We'll use the result text that gets displayed on the page to perform our assertion.

```csharp
// filename: KeyboardKeys.cs
// ...
    [Test]
    public void KeyboardKeysExample()
    {
        Driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses");

        Driver.FindElement(By.Id("target")).SendKeys(Keys.Space);
        Assert.That(Driver.FindElement(By.Id("result")).Text.Equals("You entered: SPACE"));
// ...
```

After visiting the page we find a visible element (e.g., the primary content of the page) and send the space key to it (e.g., `.SendKeys(Keys.SPACE)`). Then we grab the resulting text (e.g., `Driver.FindElement(By.Id("result")).Text`) and assert that it says what we expect (e.g., `.Equals("You entered: SPACE"`).

Alternatively, we can issue a key press without finding the element by using the Selenium Action Builder.

```csharp
// filename: KeyboardKeys.cs
// ...
        Actions Builder = new Actions(Driver);
        Builder.SendKeys(Keys.Left).Build().Perform();
        Assert.That(Driver.FindElement(By.Id("result")).Text.Equals("You entered: LEFT"));
    }
}
```

## Expected Behavior

When you save this file and run it (e.g. `nunit3-console.exe .\KeyboardKeys.sln` from the command-line) here is what will happen:

- Open the browser
- Visit the page
- Find the element and send the space key to it
- Find the result text on the page and asset it's what we expect
- Send the left arrow key to the element that's currently in focus
- Find the result text on the page and assert it's what we expect
- Close the browser

## Summary

If you have a specific element that you want to issue key presses to, then finding the element first is the way to go. If you don't have a receiving element, or you need to string together multiple key presses, then the Action Builder is what you should use.
