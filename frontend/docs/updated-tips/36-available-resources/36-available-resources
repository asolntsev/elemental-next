# Where To Look for Selenium Information

## Intro

There is a plethora of information and resources when it comes to Selenium.

## Use Case

Although Selenium information is out there, it can be challenging to sift through all of it, or to even know where to look for it. If you're struggling with an issue and need help with a solution, access to these resources and communities can be especially essential.

## A Solution

Here is a comprehensive list showing many of the Selenium resources available, and what they are useful for.

## Available Resources

### Documentation & Tips

+ [Selenium Documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)

This is the official Selenium documentation site. There is a lot of helpful information here. Use the sidebar menu on the left to navigate. Each documentation article is dated at the bottom to show when it was last modified, and the site seems to be kept fairly updated.

+ [The Selenium Wiki](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/wiki)

There is a lot of great stuff in this wiki -- mainly, documentation about the various language bindings and browser drivers. If you're not already familiar with it, take a look. It is kept very up-to-date by volunteer contributors who have donated thousands of hours in upkeep and code development.

+ [Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java - The Repo](https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-webdriver-java)

This is an open-source project created and maintained by [Boni Garcia](https://twitter.com/boni_gg). It contains a comprehensive collection of examples about Selenium 4 using Java as language binding. These examples are explained in Boni's book mentioned below in the Books section.

+ [Elemental Selenium Archives](http://elementalselenium.com/tips)==**`!! Possibly deprecated resource might need to be replaced !!`**==

Every tip Dave has written is freely available on his tips archive page. There are roughly 70 different Selenium problems and solutions covered.

### Blogs

+ [The official Selenium blog](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/)==**`!! Deprecated resource needs to be replaced; last updated 2018-09-06 !!`**==

This is where news of the Selenium project gets announced. There's also the occasional round-up of what's going on in the tech space (as it relates to testing). Definitely worth a look.

+ [A list of "all" Selenium WebDriver blogs](http://it-kosmopolit.de/Selenium/blog/selenium-blogs/selenium_blogs.php)==**`!! Broken link needs to be replaced !!`**==

At some point, someone rounded up a large list of blogs from Selenium practitioners and committers. It's a pretty good list.

### Books

+ [Hands-On Selenium WebDriver with Java - The Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-selenium-webdriver/9781098109998/)

This book is by [Boni Garcia](https://twitter.com/boni_gg) and it is a thorough resource. It outlines how to use Selenium, top-to-bottom, using Java, and is a great resource to keep handy.

+ [Selenium 2 Testing Tools](http://www.amazon.com/Selenium-Testing-Tools-Beginners-Guide/dp/1849518300)==**`!! Possibly deprecated resource might need replacing !!`**==

This book is by [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester) and it is a thorough resource. It outlines how to use Selenium, top-to-bottom, using Java. It's a good resource to keep handy.

+ [Selenium Testing Tools Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Selenium-Testing-Cookbook-Gundecha-Unmesh/dp/1849515743/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z)==**`!! Possibly deprecated resource might need replacing !!`**==

This a good book that covers more advanced ways to leverage Selenium. While I haven't had a chance to finish reading it, it's clear that Gundecha has a very pragmatic approach that will yield great results for any automated testing practice that uses Selenium.

+ [The Selenium Guidebook](https://seleniumguidebook.com)==**`!! Possibly deprecated resource might need replacing !!`**==

This is the book I wish existed when I first started out. It teaches you the basics of programming needed for automated testing, how to decompose an existing web app, how to write tests so they're reliable and maintainable, how to package things up into a test harness, and how to automate and scale your tests. I think it's pretty good, but then again, I wrote it. It's covers both Java and Ruby.

### Meetups

+ [The Selenium Hangout](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/the-worlds-best-selenium-meetup/)==**`!! Possibly deprecated resource might need replacing !!`**==

This is an entirely online meetup that is co-run by myself and [David Burns](https://twitter.com/AutomatedTester) where we talk about the latest in the Selenium community (e.g., Selenium Conf, the status of Selenium 3, the WebDriver W3C spec, etc.) and answer questions from the community. Videos are recorded and made available (along with notes) on [the official Selenium blog](http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/).

+ [All Selenium Meetups listed on Meetup.com](http://selenium.meetup.com/)==**`!! Broken link needs to be replaced !!`**==

A listing of all in-person Selenium Meetups are available on Meetup.com. If you're near a major city, odds are there's one waiting for you.

+ [How to start your own Selenium Meetup](http://sauceio.com/index.php/2011/10/so-you-want-to-start-a-selenium-meetup-group-now-what/)==**`!! Broken link needs to be replaced !!`**==

If there's not a Selenium Meetup near you, start one! Sauce Labs has a great write up on how to do it.

### Conferences

+ [Selenium Conf](http://www.seleniumconf.org/)==**`!! Broken link needs to be replaced !!`**==

This is the annual conference where practitioners and Selenium Core Committers gather and share knowledge. All of the talks are top notch, as is the hallway track. If I were to attend just one conference a year, it would be this one.

+ [Selenium Camp](http://seleniumcamp.com/)==**`!! Broken link needs to be replaced !!`**==

This is a self-organized Selenium conference that's held annually in Kiev, Ukraine. It's a well organized event with some great talks. It's the most advanced test automation conference I've attended. Definitely worth the trip.

### Videos

+ [Selenium Conference Talks](http://www.youtube.com/user/seleniumconf/videos)

Every year talks from The Selenium Conference are recorded and made freely available online. This is one of the best resources around.

+ [Selenium Meetup Talks](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=selenium%20meetup&sm=3)==**`!! Deprecated resource needs to be replaced !!`**==

Some Selenium Meetups take it upon themselves to record their talks and publish them afterwards. Here are some of them. They are a great way to see what other pockets of the community are up to (outside of the annual Selenium Conf).

+ [Selenium Hangout](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjmE7QwH0u6dXyfzlZ10f2Yz6d3mE9QEi)==**`!! Deprecated resource needs to be replaced !!`**==

All of the Selenium Hangout Meetups are recorded and made available. A lot of great stuff is discussed in them.

### Mailing Lists

+ [Selenium Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/selenium-users)
+ [Selenium LinkedIn Users Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/961927/)

These groups are fairly large, and it can be challenging at times to find what you're looking for. Even so, you can occasionally find some unique insights and answers to your questions.

+ [Agile Testing Yahoo Group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/agile-testing/)==**`!! Broken link needs to be replaced !!`**==

This list is less about Selenium and more about "testing" (in the [checking versus testing](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856) sense). It's a great place to ask for sage advice, and to hang out and listen.

### Forums

+ [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Selenium-testing-framework)
+ [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selenium/)
+ [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium)

These are amazing community forums where you can go look for answers to questions you have regarding Selenium. The forums are populated by community members who volunteer their time and expertise to answer questions and help troubleshoot towards solutions.

### Issues

+ [Selenium Issue Tracker](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/issues)

If you're running into a specific and repeatable issue that just doesn't make sense, you may have found a bug in Selenium. You'll want to check the Selenium Issue Tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, then create a new issue. But be sure to read [this post](http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/12/not-providing-html-page-is-bogus.html) before you do (so you can be sure that you've provided enough information for the Core Committers to work on it).

### IRC

The Selenium IRC Chat Channel is arguably the best way to connect with the Selenium community and get questions answered. This is where committers and practitioners hang out day-in and day-out. You can read more about what it is and how to access it [here](/tips/20-irc-chat).==**`!! Possibly deprecated resource might need replacing; link for irc info links back to an Elemental Selenium page that may no longer exist in future !!`**==

## Summary

As you can see there's a lot out there. But hopefully this list has helped guide you to the best resources for your context.

Happy Testing!
