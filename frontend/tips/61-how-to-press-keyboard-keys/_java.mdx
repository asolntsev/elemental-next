## Example

First let's import our requisite classes (for annotations (e.g., `org.junit.After`, etc.), driving the browser with Selenium (e.g., `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver`, etc.), and matchers for our assertions (e.g., `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers`, etc.)) and start our class with some setup and teardown methods.

```java
// filename: KeyboardKeys.java

import org.junit.After;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.interactions.Actions;
import org.openqa.selenium.Keys;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertThat;

public class KeyboardKeys {
    WebDriver driver;

    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        driver = new FirefoxDriver();
    }

    @After
    public void tearDown() throws Exception {
        driver.quit();
    }
// ...
```

Now we can wire up our test.

Let's use an example from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) that will display what key has been pressed ([link](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses)). We'll use the result text that gets displayed to perform our assertion.

```java
// filename: KeyboardKeys.java
// ...
    @Test
    public void uploadFile() throws Exception {
        driver.get("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses");
        driver.findElement(By.id("target")).sendKeys(Keys.SPACE);
        assertThat(driver.findElement(By.id("result")).getText(), is("You entered: SPACE"));
// ...
```

After visiting the page we find an element that's visible (e.g., the one that contains the example on the page) and send the space key to it (e.g., `builder.sendKeys(Keys.SPACE).build().perform()`). Then we grab the resulting text (e.g., `driver.findElement(By.id("result")).getText()`) and assert that it says what we expect (e.g., `is("You entered: SPACE"));`).

Alternatively, we can also issue a key press without finding the element first.

```java
// filename: KeyboardKeys.java
// ...
        Actions builder = new Actions(driver);
        builder.sendKeys(Keys.LEFT).build().perform();
        assertThat(driver.findElement(By.id("result")).getText(), is("You entered: LEFT"));
    }

}
```

## Expected Behavior

When you save this file and run it (e.g. `mvn clean test` from the command-line) here is what will happen:

+ Open the browser
+ Visit the page
+ Find the element and send the space key to it
+ Find the result text on the page and check to that it's what we expect
+ Send the left arrow key to the element that's currently in focus
+ Find the result text on the page and check to that it's what we expect
+ Close the browser

## Summary

If you have a specific element that you want to issue key presses to, then finding the element first is the way to go. But if you don't have a receiving element, or you need to string together multiple key presses, then the Action Builder is what you should use.

Happy Testing!
