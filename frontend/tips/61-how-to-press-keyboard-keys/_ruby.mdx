## Example

First we'll set up our requisite libraries to drive the browser (e.g., `selenium-webdriver`) and perform an assertion (e.g., `rspec/expections` and `RSpec::Matchers`). After that, we'll create some simple `setup`, `teardown`, and `run` methods.

```ruby
# filename: key_presses.rb

require 'selenium-webdriver'
require 'rspec/expectations'
include RSpec::Matchers

def setup
  @driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox
end

def teardown
  @driver.quit
end

def run
  setup
  yield
  teardown
end
```

Now we can write up our test.

Let's use an example from [the-internet](https://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet) that will display what key has been pressed ([link](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses)). We'll use the result text that gets displayed to perform our assertion.

```ruby
run do
  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses'
  @driver.find_element(id: 'target').send_keys :space
  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'result').text).to eql('You entered: SPACE')
end
```

After visiting the page we find an element that's visible (e.g., the one that contains the example on the page `(id: 'target')`) and send the space key to it (e.g., `.send_keys :space`). Then we grab the resulting text (e.g., `@driver.find_element(id: 'result').text)`) and assert that it says what we expect (e.g., `'You entered: SPACE'`).

Alternatively, we can also issue a key press without finding the element first.

```ruby
run do
  @driver.get 'http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses'
  @driver.action.send_keys(:tab).perform
  expect(@driver.find_element(id: 'result').text).to eql('You entered: TAB')
end
```

## Expected Behavior

If we save this and run it (e.g. `ruby key_presses.rb` from the command-line) here is what will happen:

+ Open the browser
+ Visit the page
+ Find the element and send the space key to it
+ Find the result text on the page and check to that it's what we expect
+ Send the tab key to the element that's currently in focus
+ Find the result text on the page and check to that it's what we expect
+ Close the browser

## Summary

If you have a specific element that you want to issue key presses to, then finding the element first is the way to go. If you don't have a receiving element, or you need to string together multiple key presses, then the Action Builder is what you should use.

Happy Testing!
