## Example

Let's start by importing our requisite libraries and wire up some setup and teardown methods.

```javascript
// filename: test/screenshot.spec.js
const assert = require("assert");
const { Builder, By } = require("selenium-webdriver");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

describe("Screenshot", function() {
  let driver;

  beforeEach(async function() { this.timeout(60000) driver = await new Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();
  });

  afterEach(async function() {
    if (this.currentTest.state !== "passed") {
      const testName = this.currentTest.fullTitle().replace(/\s/g, "-");
      const fileName = path.join(__dirname, `screenshot_${testName}.jpg`);
      fs.writeFileSync(fileName, await driver.takeScreenshot(), "base64");
    }
    await driver.quit();
  });
// ...
```

In `afterEach` we check to see if the test was unsuccessful (e.g., `this.currenTest.state !== "passed"`). If not, then the test has either failed or errored and we capture a screenshot through the help of Selenium's `.takeScreenshot()` function. To save it to disk, we use `fs` and its `writeFileSync` function. It takes the full path to save to, the payload (e.g., the screenshot), and the encoding (which for the image is `"base64"`).

To make the filename unique we use the test name after cleaning it up (by replacing spaces with `-`). When this command executes it will save an image file (e.g., `screenshot_Screenshot-on-failure.jpg`) to the local system in the current working directory.

Now to wire up a test which will fail.

```javascript
// filename: test/screenshot.spec.js
// ...
  it("on failure", async function() {
    await driver.get("http://the-internet.herokuapp.com");
    assert(true === false);
  });
});
```

## Expected Behavior

When we save this file and run it (`mocha` from the command-line) here is what will happen:

+ Open the browser
+ Load the homepage of [the-internet](http://github.com/saucelabs/the-internet)
+ Fail on the assertion
+ Capture a screenshot in the current working directory
+ Close the browser

## Summary

Having a screenshot to aid in troubleshooting failing tests along with a stack trace helps in having more insight.

Happy Testing!
